      may be unable to use the service.</p>
    <p>Please recognize that device information and/or log information alone cannot identify a specific individual, so
      this information itself is considered non-personal. However, if such non-personal information is combined with
      other information to identify a specific individual or with other personal information, it will be regarded as
      personal information during that combination. In such cases, it will be treated as personal information and
      protected according to this policy. Unless authorized by you or otherwise stipulated by applicable laws and
      regulations, such personal information will be anonymized and de-identified.</p>
    <h4>Offering Client Server or User Response Services</h4>
    <p>When you reach out to us for Client Server or user responses (such as inquiries, feedback, suggestions,
      complaints, etc.), we may request necessary personal information to match and verify your user identity, ensuring
      the security of your account and system. We may store details like your communication/call records, conversations,
      or contact information to reach you or assist in resolving issues, or to record the solutions and outcomes of
      related problems. Therefore, we process your personal data for these purposes in accordance with our agreement
      with you. This personal data may also be processed to protect your legitimate interests, namely to obtain relevant
      information about your services and other related data from ShortMax.</p>
    <h4>Providing Information Display and Recommendation Services</h4>
    <p>We may use your information (such as interests, personalized tags, browsing and search history, device
      information, usage habits, location information, order information, etc.) and combine it to extract your browsing,
      search preferences, behavior patterns, and location information through recommendation algorithm modeling,
      programming, advertising models, user behavior analysis, and user profiling. This enables us to offer page
      displays and personalized content recommendations that better suit your needs.</p>
    <h4>Sending Notifications to You</h4>
    <p>We may send you service-related notices when necessary (e.g., when we suspend individual services due to system
      maintenance). If you wish to stop receiving messages from us, you can request that we cease sending them. However,
      we may continue to send messages in accordance with applicable laws and regulations.</p>
    <h4>Ensuring Your Security</h4>
    <p>In addition to identity verification, we may use your information for Client Server, security prevention, fraud
      monitoring, archiving, and backup purposes to ensure the security of the services we provide. We may use or
      integrate the information we collect, and obtain information authorized by you or legally shared with our partners
      to comprehensively assess your account and transaction risks, conduct real-name authentication, detect and prevent
      security incidents, and take necessary records, audits, analysis, and disposal actions as required by law.</p>

    <h4>Other Uses of Anonymous Information</h4>
    <p>You understand and agree that in certain cases, after collecting your information, we will de-identify and fully
      anonymize the data through technical means, so it no longer constitutes personal data directly or indirectly
      related to you or others. The de-identified information does not identify or relate to you. In this case, we
      reserve the right to use such de-identified information for analysis and monetization of the user database.</p>
    <p>If we intend to use your information for purposes not outlined in this Policy, we will seek your prior consent
      through page prompts, interactive processes, website announcements, or other means. Once you agree, such
